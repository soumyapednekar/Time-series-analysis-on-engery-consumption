# Time Series Forecasting: Energy Consumption Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes household energy consumption trends using time series forecasting techniques.
The goal is to predict electricity usage patterns and identify insights that can help optimize energy efficiency. 
We apply ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to develop accurate forecasting models, leveraging real-world power consumption data.
